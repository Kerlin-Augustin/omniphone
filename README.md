This website allows you to click a button to buy a product. The product goes into a queue and can be returned if you click on them again.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB

My learning was focused on putting items in a queue then if I change my mind take that item out of queue. Creating a store website was the perfect oppurtunity to practice putting items on in a queue as well as a database. Then erase the item and data information from the database if the person chooses to return the item.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned <%= %> allows the ejs content to show on the screen and <% %> will remain on the backend. This was really helpful to learn early so the syntax could make more sense moving forward.
